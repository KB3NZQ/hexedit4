Aerial View Scanning
====================

A background thread is created to scan the file to build up a bitmap for
display in an "aerial view" which can show an alternative view to the
normal hex view of a document.

Note This background scan  may later also be used to generate stats
on the file such as byte counts.

Document
--------

A background thread is created for every document that has at least
one aerial view.  It has a low priority (LOWEST?).  Communication with
the thread is achieved using these document members:

start_aerial_event_: signals the thread it needs to do something when in wait state
aerial_command_: command to the thread to tell it what to do: scan, stop, die
aerial_state_: updated by the thread to say what it's doing: waiting, scanning or dying
aerial_fin_: true if last scan finished OK, false if none done yet or last stopped
docdata_: a critical section to protect access to shared document members

pfile3_: is a ptr to file open the same as pfile1_.  Using a separate file allows the main thread
		 to read from the file without having to lock docdata_.  Locking is only required
		 when the background thread accesses the file or the main thread changes it.
		 This means that file display should never be slowed by the background thread.
loc_: accessed (via GetData) in main/search/aerial threads to get data from the file
undo_: loc_ uses data stored in undo array


Background thread
-----------------

The thread has 4 states: starting, waiting, scanning and dying.  When waiting it is
blocked by the event (start_aerial_event_), and to change the state the event needs to be
pulsed (and a command given).

While scanning it regularly checks for a new command (aerial_command_) while in its
processing loop.  If it detects a "stop" command it goes back into the wait state.
If it detects a "die" command the thread terminates itself.

After the thread scans the whole file it also goes back into the wait state.
But first it signals the main thread which is passed on to the document
and thence to all aerial views so they can update themselves.
Note that if a modal dialog is active when the ::PostThreadMessage is called
to send the message to the main thread then the message is lost.
It also sets aerial_fin_ to true.

Changes (CHexEditDoc::Change, CHexEditDoc::Undo in DocData.cpp)
-------

When a document is changed the scan needs to be restarted.

This may later be changed to allow small document changes to update
the bitmap without having to rescan the whole thing.  This would work
fine for replacements.  For deletions a memove() would be required.
For small insertions only a memove may be required but it may be that
the bitmap has to be resized, which may be handled by realloc or
just a complete re-scan.


Views (see CBGSearchHint used by CHexEditView::OnUpdate)
-----

When the colour scheme of the view used to generate the aerial view
is changed then the file has to be rescanned as the bitmap
colours may be completely different.  This is complicated by the 
fact that a document may have more than one view using different
colour schemes.
