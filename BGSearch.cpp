Description of Background Searches
==================================

Document
--------

The document (CHexEditDoc) is where background searching is controlled.
A background thread is created for each open document (if bg searching is on).
The document with the active view has a thread with priority LOWEST.
Other documents have a thread with priority IDLE.

Several document data members are used by the background thread:

start_search_event_: signal from main thread to background thread to start searching
search_state_: what the thread is currently doing
  STARTING: thread has just started and not yet blocked at start_search_event_
  WAITING: thread is blocked at start_search_event_
  SCANNING: thread is doing what it is supposed to
  DYING: thread received message to kill itself and is doing so
search_command_: what we want the thread to do now
search_fin_: indicates that background search was finished succcesfully (not running or aborted)
docdata_: is a critical section used to protect access to the other shared data members below

pfile2_: is a ptr to file open the same as pfile1_.  Using a separate file allows the main thread
		 to read from pfile1_ without having to lock docdata_.  Locking is only required
		 when the background thread accesses the file or the main thread changes it.
		 This means that file display should never be slowed by the background thread.
loc_: accessed (via GetData) in both threads to get data from the file
undo_: loc_ uses data stored in undo array

to_search_: list of areas of the file to search
found_: addresses where occurences were found
main_thread_id: used by background thread to signal the main thread (PostThreadMessage)

to_adjust_: list of adjustments to be done by bg thread when a file change is made
			allows bg thread to fix found_ to allow for file changes and the bg thread
			to fix its internal addresses to allow for insertions/deletions
	
Background thread
-----------------

The thread (see bg_func) waits for a signal to start searching (start_search_event_).
It then gets the next area to search from the list to_search_.  While searching
it adds any occurrences found to the set found_.

When to_search_ becomes empty it sets search_fin_ and goes back to the wait state.
When the doc sees that search_fin_ is true it updates all its views to show the new
occurrences and sets search_fin_ to false, so it doesn't do it again.

While searching the bg search also continually checks search_command_ to see
if the current search has been cancelled (eg, if a new search string has been
entered) or if the thread has been killed (eg, if background searches are
turned off).

When the search is finished or after it is cancelled the bg thread signals
that it is ready to start a new search by setting search_state_ to WAITING.

Application
-----------

The current search is system wide so that when a new background search is started
all documents are informed of the change. The application stores info on the
current search in the following members:

appdata_: is a critical section used to protect access to the application data below
pboyer_: determines the bytes to be searched for
icase_: determines if the search is case-insensitive
text_type_: characters set used (ASCII, EBCDIC, Unicode) for case-insensitive searches
wholeword_, alignment_, offset_, align_rel_, base_addr_: other search options

The app also has a few routines for background searches
StartSearches: starts background searches in the other (inactive) documents
NewSearch: changes pboyer_, icase_, text_type_

Searches (See CMainFrame::search_forw and CMainFrame::search_back)
--------

When a search is requested it is first checked if this is a new search or
a repeat of the last search.  If it is a new search any background search
is cancelled by setting search_command_ to STOP, then the search is performed 
as normal in the main thread, and the new background search is started after this
search is finished.  (We also wait on the background thread to signal that it
has aborted the current background search and is waiting to start a new search.)

When the background search is started some of the current file has already
been searched by the main thread.  The to_search_ list allows for this by
having only the area(s) not yet searched added to it.  If the first (main
thread) search has found something (ie. was not aborted or hit EOF) then
the to_search_ list is extended by one byte so that this occurrence is also
detected by the bg thread.

Other files currently open are also searched (at a lower priority) but in this
case the whole file is searched.

If the search is a repeat of a previous search then if bg searching is finished 
found_ is checked to quickly get the required address.  If the background
search is still in progress then a foreground search is performed as normal,
and the background search is left running.  This could possibly be optimised
to check the list of areas left to search and compare it with where the 
search is to take place.

Changes (CHexEditDoc::Change, CHexEditDoc::Undo in DocData.cpp)
-------

When a document is changed the changed area has to be updated in all views
in case some search occurrences have gone or been created.  Also if there
are deletions/insertions the displayed occurrences move within the views.

Any bg search currently in progress has to be informed of any address changes
due to insertions or deletions (see to_adjust_).  Also the changed area is added
to to_search_ so that any new occurrences are found.

In the bg thread whenever the document data is accessed the to_adjust_ list
of address adjustments is checked and internal variables adjusted first.
	
Views (see CBGSearchHint used by CHexEditView::OnUpdate)
-----

An advantage of bg searches is that all occurrences of a string can be
highlighted (eg. with a yellow background) once the background search has
completed.  When a search for a different string of bytes is started then
all views are signalled to remove any highlighting.  When a background
search has finished for one document then all its views are told to update
themselves using the new addresses in the document's found_ member.

Each view keeps a vector of areas where bg search occurrences were found
(in its current display rectangle) called search_pair_.  This is only updated
when the current display position is moved (via ValidateScroll) or when 
the current search string changes.  This saves recalc in every OnDraw.
